*Instructions:*
You will identify a data source (which might be a combination of datasets) that relates to a research question of your choosing. You’ll apply the seven principles from Data Feminism to this data source and give a critical reflection of the data with regard to your question. Part of this critical reflection will be a plan for analysis that would allow you to answer your research question in the context of a critical view of these data.

Data Feminism
According to Catherine D’Ignazio & Lauren F. Klein, the seven organizing principles of data feminism are: (1) Examine power, (2) Challenge power, (3) Elevate emotion & embodiment; (4) Rethink binaries & hierarchies, (5) Embrace pluralism, (6) Consider context, and, (7) Make labor visible.

The Proposal
In the proposal, you will identify the question and then describe the context. What is gained from this analysis? What are the costs? Pay particular attention to unintended consequences, which may be anticipated from similar kinds of projects.

The structure of the proposal is as follows:
A. Introductory paragraph in which the question is identified in context.
B. A description of a data source (or sources) that can be used to answer the question. This will include considerations about data quality (methods, validity, reliability).
C. A plan for analysis.

The Report
The visualization and report will be due at the end of the semester. The structure of the report will be as follows:
A. Introduction
B. Critical reflection of the data (application of the seven principles)
C. Plan for analysis and any preliminary analysis/visualization
D. Reflection on ethical approaches to answering the research question.
E. Additional resources (this might be other sources of data or a statement about what good data would be)

*Project Outline:*
A. Introduction  
 
Research Question: How can predictive modeling be applied to COVID-19 outbreaks in the United States, taking into account geospatial data of military bases, hospitals, airports, and other factors, to improve our understanding of the pandemic's spread? 
 
The goal of this study is to use predictive modeling for COVID-19 outbreaks by incorporating geospatial data from military bases, hospitals, and airports across the United States. The central question is how to use data to better understand the spread of the pandemic and its potential impact on critical locations. To answer this question, we will use the seven Data Feminism principles to critically assess and analyze the data sources. 
 
B. Data Set (subject to change; addition of new data sets will be incorporated)  

 
COVID-19 Data Set Cases: This dataset provides daily information on confirmed COVID-19 cases in the US. It includes geographical data, time series data, and case counts by location. COVID-19 Data 

  

Hospital GeoData: The Hospital GeoData dataset offers geospatial information on hospitals, including their locations and capabilities. Hospital GeoData 

  

Military GeoData: The Military GeoData dataset provides information about military bases' locations and their characteristics. Military GeoData 

  

Airports GeoData: The Airports GeoData dataset contains information about airports across the United States. It includes data on airport locations, size, and functionality. Airports GeoData 
 
C. Plan for Analysis  
 
Examine Power: Examine the potential impact of COVID-19 on various locations and determine whether certain areas, such as military bases, are more vulnerable to outbreaks due to personnel movement. 
 
Challenge Power: Investigate disparities in healthcare access by examining hospital proximity to vulnerable communities and identifying potential inequities. 
 
Elevate Emotion & Embodiment: Consider the emotional impact of the pandemic on different communities, as well as how it may be exacerbated by the location of essential services and military bases. 
 
Rethink Binaries & Hierarchies: Investigate how the pandemic affects both urban and rural areas, as well as whether COVID-19 impacts vary by location. 
 
Embrace Pluralism: Recognize the diversity of pandemic experiences across regions, as well as how the presence of airports and military bases may affect different communities. 
 
Consider Context: Examine the geographic context of COVID-19 outbreaks, including how airport traffic may contribute to the spread. 
 
Make Labor Work Visible: Examine the workforces in critical locations, such as hospital healthcare workers and military personnel, and their exposure to the virus.
