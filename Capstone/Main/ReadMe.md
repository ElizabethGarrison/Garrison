*Instructions:*
You will identify a data source (which might be a combination of datasets) that relates to a research question of your choosing. You’ll apply the seven principles from Data Feminism to this data source and give a critical reflection of the data with regard to your question. Part of this critical reflection will be a plan for analysis that would allow you to answer your research question in the context of a critical view of these data.

Data Feminism
According to Catherine D’Ignazio & Lauren F. Klein, the seven organizing principles of data feminism are: (1) Examine power, (2) Challenge power, (3) Elevate emotion & embodiment; (4) Rethink binaries & hierarchies, (5) Embrace pluralism, (6) Consider context, and, (7) Make labor visible.

The Proposal
In the proposal, you will identify the question and then describe the context. What is gained from this analysis? What are the costs? Pay particular attention to unintended consequences, which may be anticipated from similar kinds of projects.

The structure of the proposal is as follows:
A. Introductory paragraph in which the question is identified in context.
B. A description of a data source (or sources) that can be used to answer the question. This will include considerations about data quality (methods, validity, reliability).
C. A plan for analysis.

The Report
The visualization and report will be due at the end of the semester. The structure of the report will be as follows:
A. Introduction
B. Critical reflection of the data (application of the seven principles)
C. Plan for analysis and any preliminary analysis/visualization
D. Reflection on ethical approaches to answering the research question.
E. Additional resources (this might be other sources of data or a statement about what good data would be)

*Project Outline:*
A. Introduction: The research question focuses on understanding the factors influencing school shootings in America, considering the societal, gendered, and contextual aspects of these incidents.

B. Data Sources: The primary data source would be the K-12 School Shooting Database (k12ssdb.org), providing detailed records of school shootings. However, it's crucial to note the limitations of this data—its quality might vary in terms of completeness, accuracy, and potential biases in reporting. To complement this, additional data sources such as:

Demographic Data: Census Bureau data or education department datasets can provide insights into regional socio-economic factors, racial demographics, and educational profiles.
Gun Legislation Data: Examining state-by-state gun laws from authoritative sources can shed light on the relationship between policy and incidence of school shootings.
Mental Health Statistics: Accessing mental health institution data or surveys can offer insights into mental health access, stigma, and prevalence of conditions linked to such incidents.
Plan for Analysis: Analyzing these data sources collectively involves:

Quantitative Analysis: Descriptive statistics and geospatial analysis can identify trends, frequencies, and geographical patterns of school shootings.
Qualitative Analysis: Interviews or surveys with survivors, educators, and communities affected by school shootings can provide nuanced perspectives and qualitative data.
Intersectional Analysis: Considering how race, gender, socio-economic status, and policy interplay in the occurrence and aftermath of these events.
C. Critical Reflection of Data:

Examine Power: Assess how power dynamics (e.g., political, racial, gendered) shape data collection, representation, and interpretation.
Challenge Power: Critically question biases within the data, considering underreporting, misclassification, or selective coverage of incidents.
Embrace Pluralism: Recognize diverse perspectives, amplifying voices that might be marginalized or overlooked in the data.
Consider Context: Understand that each incident exists within a broader social, cultural, and policy context—avoid reductionist analysis.
Make Labor Visible: Acknowledge the efforts of those who collect and compile data, while recognizing potential limitations in their approaches.
D. Ethical Approaches: Ensure ethical considerations guide the research process, respecting privacy, consent, and confidentiality of individuals involved. Additionally, consider the implications of findings—avoiding perpetuating stereotypes or stigmatizing communities.

E. Additional Resources: Seek other sources of data that provide a more comprehensive understanding of the complexities surrounding school shootings. This could include victim impact reports, mental health support access, or educational reform proposals.
